# Day 1 â€” Foundations & First Circuits

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Understand what embedded systems and microcontrollers are, and how they differ.
- Get familiar with popular microcontrollers (Arduino Uno/Nano, ESP32).
- Explore the Arduino board (digital/analog/power pins).
- Write the first Arduino sketch and run the built-in LED.
- Learn basics of Voltage (V), Current (I), Resistance (R) and breadboard wiring.

## ðŸ§  Topics
- Embedded Systems vs. Microcontrollers  
- Popular Microcontrollers: Arduino (Uno/Nano), ESP32  
- Arduino Board Tour: digital, analog, power pins  
- First Program: Built-in LED (blink)  
- Ohmâ€™s Law (V, I, R) and basic circuits  
- Breadboard usage & simple LED circuit

## ðŸ§ª Labs & Mini-Projects
1) **Blinking LED** (Hello Arduino)  
2) **LED with LDR** (auto-brightness using a photoresistor)  
3) **LED with Sound Sensor** (react to sound levels)
